# Waffle
Waffle helps you check whenever any domain is trusted or not by your organization thanks to a simple file containing your domains.

## ``domain.yml``
This is where all the _magic_ üßô‚Äç‚ú® happens!

The ``domain.yml`` file contains all of your domains and allows you to programatically check the importance and usage of each domain, including deprecation!
